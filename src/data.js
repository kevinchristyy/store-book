      "In The 48 Laws of Power, Robert Greene asserts that whether you like it or not, you’re part of a never-ending game of power. You’re either striving for and wielding power, or you’re a pawn being played by someone more powerful than you. You choose your role. This book is for those who prefer to be players rather than pawns. To turn you from an amateur into a master player, Greene has codified 48 laws of power based on historical examples of people who’ve excelled or failed at wielding power, with glorious or bloody results (or both). Some key principles you’ll learn: use your enemies, keep others dependent on you, say as little as possible, take credit for others’ work, and don’t get your hands dirty. You can choose to apply or dismiss these rules - but you can’t escape them.",

    summary:
      "How do figures such as Albert Einstein and Marie Curie do their greatest work? And can we follow in their footsteps? In Mastery, Robert Greene, famous for The 48 Laws of Power, argues that there is a clear path anyone can follow to achieve mastery, the highest level of creative excellence. He explains the three stages of mastery, and he argues that pursuing it yields a fulfilling life and great creative power. Our guide explains Mastery in four parts, breaking down how Greene defines mastery and how to pursue it. You’ll learn how to develop new skills, discover why social know-how is crucial to rising in your field, and gain strategies for performing high-level creative work. We’ll expand and scrutinize Greene’s ideas with perspectives from other prominent guides to high-level skillfulness—including The Art of Learning, Peak, and George Leonard’s Mastery. We’ll also examine where Greene appears to contradict himself, and whether you can achieve mastery at any age.",
